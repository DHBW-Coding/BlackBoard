# Installation

You need to have a working Rust instance. Build with `cargo build`. This will build the library, too.

# Run

Run with `cargo run`. You can pass arguments via `cargo run -- <args>`. For all options, use `cargo run -- --help`. Options are used to set the api address. This can be omitted if the default ip is used.
